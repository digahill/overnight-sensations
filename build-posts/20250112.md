Not much progress the last few days, but I did finally receive all of the crossover parts. I've also been learning Fusion 360, so that we can use my buddy's laser cutter to quickly create router jigs for all of the cutouts.

I tested the crossover layouts on a cardboard template. Once I was happy with it, I transferred the holes to some 1/4" plywood that has been sanded. board are about 3 1/2" x 4 3/4".

If anyone could help: Do I really need to hot glue all these parts down? It seems like that would look sloppy. Is there some other way to stop rattles? I assume that is the main reason people use hot glue...

Thanks for any advice.

The laser cutter is pretty awesome for making router jigs. The only drawback is the charred edges. They need to be cleaned up a bit so ash doesn't get everywhere. A light sand with 220 then wiping down with a damp rag mostly did the trick. Hopefully none of that black comes off on finished pieces now.

I ended up buying some cheap through hole screw terminals for the other three crossovers. This made soldering much, much easier. And I think it looks cleaner.

While I like the look of the wood board for the crossovers, I'd probably try to fab PCBs next time. It took a good amount of time drill out the holes, connect the wires on back, jumper them, etc. I bet I could install on a PCB in less than a third of the time.

I'm hoping to get to my brother's shop soon to work out a better approach for those facets this week.

Thanks for the advice regarding the inductors. I simply rotated the small ones 90 degrees. I had to uncoil about an inch of the winding to avoid drilling new holes in the boards and resoldering, but from what I read this shouldn't cause any audible difference.

We also tweaked some of the jigs to get a better press fit for the tweeters. The laser cutter makes that a breeze.

I'm a little worried the jigs aren't going to make it through all the sticking and removal of the double sided tape. I'm going to try to use as little as necessary and just be careful as I can removing the tape.

The thicker the jig, the more black ash/soot I had to clean out of the cuts. 3/8" is about as thick as I would go for MDF. 1/4" ply cuts even cleaner and faster.

We found a way to seamlessly incorporate the port with the hardwood. We used a 1/2" round over bit and took part of the schedule 40 pipe with it. I special ordered some black "furniture grade" ABS and it looks even better.

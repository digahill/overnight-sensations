My laser cutter buddy knows how to design PCBs, so we decided to layout a new board in kicad. Even though I like the wood look that I have with the current crossovers, I thought it would be cool to learn more about the PCB process. We sent the final layout to PCBWay and should have the boards in a week or 2.

I also added all of my project files (including these build log posts) to github. You can check that out at [digahill/overnight-sensations](https://github.com/digahill/overnight-sensations).

On the woodworking front, we re-sawed and bookmatched some 1/8" curly maple veneer and worked out the table saw jig to cut the facets. The table saw is working much better than the track saw for the facets, which should have been obvious from the start. Even for the sides. Thanks again @prairieboy. Also, [Troels Gravesen](http://www.troelsgravesen.dk/tips.htm#Faceting) has some good advice on faceting.

We are using a vacuum to attach the veneer to 1/2" MDF. Once I make it back to my brothers shop, we should be able to start cutting and assembling. Hopefully that happens in the next couple days.

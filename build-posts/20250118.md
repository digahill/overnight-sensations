Last night we started cutting the router jigs with my buddy's Falcon 22w laser. It took some time to get the cutting speed and number of passes dialed in. You can see in one pic that we cut too slow and started a fire while figuring it out.

We used 1/2" MDF, which ended up required 4 passes. This took probably 10 minutes for each piece. I'm going to take over 1/4" ply and 3/8" MDF today to see if we can crank through the rest faster. There is a very slight taper to the cuts, since the laser loses focus the deeper the cut gets. But I don't think it's going to be an issue. Also, the thinner material should reduce the taper effect, too.

The pics attached are the test piece (burned), the tweeter hole and faceplate, and the speakon and port guides.

The final cuts were making the facets, which was actaully easy. But painstakingly slow, since hitting the exact marks on the start and finish of the side facets was tricky. We kept needing to microadjust the miter to sneak up on both marks with the same cut. 

Then the real fun began. Sanding with 80/120/150/220 with the festool. That thing is a beast. The baffles only needed 150/220, and we did those by hand so that we didnt ruin the facet edges.

We really shouldnt have needed to sand with 80, but I think we were going to deep with the drum sander when making the panels. Next time, I would be much gentler with the drum and go to 120 with it. Its a pain to change the paper, but probably worth the time saved on the hand sanding.

These things came out buttery smooth after the 220 grit.

I finished my set with 2 coats of Odies Oil then installed the components. I bought a PEBA crimper kit for the spades - that worked really well. Highly recommended for $20 on Amazon. I also used some of that tacky picture hanger putty to better sir seal the tweeter and speakon holes. I have no idea if this will stand the test of time, but it seems to be working well so far.

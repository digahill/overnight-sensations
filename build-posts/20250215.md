The first step for the back panels was to route out the speakon terminal inset. The smallest router bit I could find was 3/16", which is a larger radius than the speakon terminal corners. To compensate, I offset the cut about 1/16" to try to make it looks good. I don't think this ended up working very well. I wish I could have found a smaller bit. 

After the inset was done we routed the speakon trough hole. In hindsight, I wish we would have had a drill bit for each of the through hole sizes on these cabinets. That would have been much faster than all of the routing.

With the speakon holes done, we routed the inset for the ports from the inside face of the back panels.

Since we glued up the sides/top/bottom first, we were able to then tweak the back panels to fit just right on the table saw. We did this by test fitting each back panel to its box, then using brass shims and the miter sled to take tiny bits off in the right spots. These shims ended up coming in very handy for a few things on the project.

After gluing the ports into the inset with CA glue, we glued up the backs to the shells. 

The baffles are next up.

Last night we built a quick test box and tested out some facet cuts on a baffle. We were using a track saw to cut the facets. I thought this would be fairly easy, but we were struggling to hit all the marks. We are going to think about a better way over the next couple of days. Possibly by using a bandsaw with a taper jig or something.

Don't mind the box wonkiness, we were using some scraps that were pretty wavy. We were considering 1" and 1.5" thick baffles. After testing with the 1", there is no reason we see to even cut the 1.5". The 1" looks great.

We cut 2 different facet angles. I like the right-side angle better, but I also kinda like the asymmetric look. Maybe we will consider that for the final build...

My biggest takeaway from last night is that these boxes are SMALL. In a good way. They will easily fit on a desk, on a TV cabinet, anywhere, really.

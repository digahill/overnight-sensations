We drum sanded the veneered panels to thickness with 80 grit. In retrospect, we should have gone to 120 grit. It would have made final sanding much quicker. This was my first time using a drum sander. There’s a learning curve to getting just the right settings to keep the pieces automatically feeding without stalling. When that happens you get a nice divot, which takes many more passes to remove. 

We ended up with two panels per box. One for the top, sides, and bottoms, which will be grain matched at the miters. And a second for the back. 

Then we re-squared all the panels. The process was pretty simple once we figured it out. I’m not sure if this is how someone more seasoned would go about it, though. 

1. Use a track saw to rip parallel to the book matched glue line. 
2. Use a miter sled to crosscut both small ends square to the step 1 cut.
3. Use a table saw to rip the opposite side from step 1 to the final distance from the bookmatch glue line (half the total final dimansion). 
4. Once all panels of the same size were through step 3, set the table saw to the final dimension for that panel. Set the table saw fence to the final dimension and rip all pieces on the same side from step 1. 

This means you are cutting that first side twice. First to square with the track saw. Second to perfect width with the final table rip. Maybe? Yes. But it left us with very consistent sizes. 

Then we mitered all pieces to final size using stop blocks. The most annoying parts of this were:

1. Having to tape all of the edges to prevent tear out.
2. Fiddling with the miter gauge to get it perfectly square.

Before gluing up the sides/top/bottom, we drilled the bottom inside panels for our press fit inserts. These will hold the crossover standoffs. The inserts are knurled and made for heat pressing into plastic. But with the right size drillbit, they were great for pressing right into MDF. We didn’t even have to glue them.

We weren’t sure if our miters were going to be perfect enough to simply tape all the joints together so we used box clamps for the first one. After that, we realized everything was pretty well aligned and simply used tape for the rest. If there was a small problem with the joint, we just used more tape to tweak and re-enforce the problem area.

While that glue up was drying, we prepared the back panels. I’ll share those details in another post.

We ended up with 2 cherry and 2 maple baffles. The cherry pieces were about 1 1/8" thick. The maple was just under 1". We cut them to be about 1/8" bigger in length and width than the shells so that we could flush trim them to the perfect size after glue up. We also decided that we would cut the facets after glue up, since that would be easier. But if we made a mistake on the facets after glue up, that would be a big problem. We thought the risk was worth it, as we were pretty confident in the facet technique we were playing around with a couple weeks ago.

Again, we used router jigs to get the woofer and tweeter holes just right. Then put a nice big chamfer on the insides.

We had one router jig slip, but luckily it was on the through hole of the woofer, so no big deal. We cleaned this up with a spindle sander. This sander also made it really easy to open up the tweeter through holes to just the right size for a press fit.

After gluing up the baffles, we bought a big 1/2" shank compression flush trim bit. It made easy work of flush trimming the baffles to the box. I wish we would have had this thing for the whole project. Not cheap, but so much better than the smaller flush trim bits.

We rounded over the port opening. Unfortunately, our veneer ended up being way thinner than expected, so we couldn't do the full 1/2" round over we were hoping for. But they still look pretty awesome.

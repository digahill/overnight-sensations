I ended up using zip ties and hot glue for the first board last night. Before soldering everything together, I use alligator clips and some test tones to make sure all my connections were right. As best I could tell, the hi pass and low pass outputs were crossing over around the proper frequencies. I didn't use a scope or anything, I just played a variety of test tones (200Hz, 1kHz, 5kHz, etc) and listened through some old computer speakers I had lying around.

I'm trying as best I can to make these look great, but it was kind of a pain to try to make the backside with the solder joints look good. I think it was more difficult because I was not using terminal blocks for everything. Instead, I connected the 16 gauge wire directly to other leads. Using zip ties as a strain relief to lock in the jacket was a late add that worked well.

Next time I'll probably try to find some through hole terminal blocks for the speaker wires.

Unfortunately, the resisters and one cap already released from the hot glue, even though I used plenty. Since everything is locked in with the leads through hole, I think it is OK. The glue is still acting as a buffer to the wood and the parts hopefully wont rattle. I can't imagine that's even a big concern in such a small build.

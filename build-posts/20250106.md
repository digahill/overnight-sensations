For Christmas 2024, I bought my brother the parts to build some bookshelf speakers. We are using the Overnight Sensations design, modeled after dgunther’s faceted cabinet build. Unfortunately, I can’t find a build plan on the internet, so it’s more of an inspiration than anything.

My brother has a woodshop with some really nice equipment, so we are going for a furniture grade finish. He has 6/4 cherry and curly maple on hand, so we will probably use that. The plan at this point is to cut our own 1/8” veneer and apply over 1/2” MDF to create 5/8” panels. These panels will be used for everything except the baffle and removable back.

The baffle will probably be thick solid cherry, so that the facets can be cut. Probably around 1”. The removable back panel will probably be solid wood, also, so that we can build an integrated port with a nice roundover.

Attached are the drawings for the initial concept. Since we are using 5/8" panels with a 1" faceted baffle, some size adjustments from Paul Carmody's 1/2" and 3/4" versions needed to be made. In these drawings, the speakers have been lowered by 1/2". The internal volume is right around 278 cubic inches, which is between Paul's 3/4" and 1/2" designs (270 cu in and 280 cu in respectively). Hopefully that is good enough.

I'm hoping we can mount the crossover to the removable back panel, but I can't test fit until all the parts are delivered.

If you see any issues with this design, we are very open to feedback.
